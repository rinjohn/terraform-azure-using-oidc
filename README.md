# Azure Authentication with OIDC and Service Principal using Terraform

This repository provides a comprehensive example demonstrating how to authenticate to Azure using OpenID Connect (OIDC) and a service principal while running Terraform.

## Key Components

### Azure Authentication
- **OIDC (OpenID Connect)**: An identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server.
- **Service Principal**: A security identity used by applications, services, and automation tools to access specific Azure resources. It can be thought of as a user identity (username and password or certificate) with a role and permissions to access resources.

### Terraform
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. It can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.
- **Running Terraform**: The example in the repository shows how to configure Terraform scripts to use the authenticated session to deploy and manage Azure resources.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Setting Up OIDC
- Configure your identity provider (e.g., Azure AD) to support OIDC.
- Register your application with the identity provider to obtain the necessary client ID and secret.

### 2. Creating a Service Principal
- In Azure, create a service principal that Terraform will use to authenticate and perform actions.
- Assign the necessary roles and permissions to the service principal to ensure it has the required access to manage resources.

### 3. Configuring Terraform
- Update your Terraform configuration files to include the necessary provider settings for Azure.
- Use the client ID, client secret, and other details from the service principal to authenticate Terraform with Azure.

### 4. Running Terraform Scripts
- Execute Terraform commands (`terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`) to deploy and manage your infrastructure.
- Terraform will use the authenticated session to interact with Azure resources securely.

This detailed example helps users understand the process of securely authenticating to Azure and managing resources using Terraform, leveraging modern authentication protocols and best practices.
